// Taken from formancy.ai, where 0069 decided a CLA and said the part that
// mattered: "a CLA nobody checks is a document in a repository." It matters
// more here, not less: the whole product is distributed under terms that are
// not an open-source licence, and a contribution that arrived under no terms
// at all would be one the project could not distribute that way.
//
// Run by `.github/workflows/cla.yml` on every pull request, and by
// `scripts/check-cla.test.mjs`, which calls these functions rather than a stub
// of them. `node scripts/check-cla.mjs --hash` prints the hash a signature
// records.
//
// What this cannot do is say whether a signature means anything; that is a
// question for a lawyer, and formancy.ai's 0098 says so instead of implying a
// check settles it. What it does is make the absence of one loud.
